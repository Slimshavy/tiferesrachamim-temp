	The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) 
	that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on 
	its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.
